•	Sorting in C++ is a concept in which the element of an array are rearranged in a logical order.
 
•	In internal sorting, the data to be sorted is present in the main memory or RAM, and sorting  process will also occur in the main memory itself. Examples of internal sorting arebubble sort , insertion sort , selection sort.
•	While in the case of external sorting, the data is not always present in the RAM because the data is large. So data is filled in the RAM or main memory in small portions. An example of external sorting is the merge sort.
